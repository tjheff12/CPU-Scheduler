# CPU-Scheduler
This C++ program simulates difference CPU scheduling techniques. The options are first in first out (fifo), shortest job first (sjf), and round robin (rr). 

The input for this program is the file input.txt. The first number is the cpu cycle in which the task arrives, and the second number is how many cycles needed to finish the task. The easiet way to input this file into the program is to pipe it into the executable. You must also choose a scheduling technique. The options are -fifo, -sjf, and -rr. The command I use to run the program is "cat input.txt | ./executable_name -fifo".
